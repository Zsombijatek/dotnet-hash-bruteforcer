# .NET Hash Bruteforcer

> A project to excercise and solve new problems that are found along the way of making the application.


## 1. Description of the program

+ The program is written in `C#` and ***only*** uses `CPU` threads.
+ It creates every possible combination from the given hardcoded charset which contains `90` characters including:
  + *Numbers*
  + *Letters*
  + *Special characters*
+ This is achieved by starting to generate guesses with the lowest possible length and working its way up to the given max. length for the words.
+ The default max. length is `6` which can be changed by the user from `4-âˆž`
+ The guesses to be checked are distributed evenly, based on the serial number of the given thread and the maximum available threads:
  +  `E.g.`:    If the thread's serial number is `2` and the max. available threads is `4`<br>
                --> The `2nd` guess will be given to this thread at start and after that the `6th` guess will be given.
